# JavaBasicsPartOne - Day 1 of Week 3/12 (JAVA)
In the first day of week 3 (JAVA week), we were assigned to create methods that:

1. Return first n fibonacci numbers.
2. Return sum of first n EVEN or ODD numbers.
3. Swap values. -> My approach was swapping values in an array.

I was curious and I tried different "new" things such as Enum, throw exception, try catch.
